## 🌟 Overview

This repository contains my **Day 1 submission** for the **Murf AI – 10 Days of Voice Agents Challenge**.

For Day 1, I set up a fully working **real-time voice agent** using **Murf Falcon**, LiveKit, Deepgram, and React/Next.js.

To test the agent, I used one of my **upcoming COA exam topics** — **RISC vs CISC architecture**.  
The agent:

- Explained the topic clearly  
- Responded almost instantly  
- Handled my follow-up question mid-explanation  
- Continued the original topic without losing context  

A solid start for Day 1 🚀
